-- Part A Quesion 1
-- I am literally dropping the existed constraints and  writing a new ones according to the question requirements
-- in part A i am basically deleting the book from the parent table and all its children tables by using
-- on delete cascade

ALTER TABLE yrb_offer drop constraint yrb_off_fk_book;
ALTER TABLE yrb_purchase drop constraint yrb_pur_fk_offer;

ALTER TABLE yrb_offer ADD constraint yrb_off_fk_book_with_del
foreign key (title, year) references yrb_book on delete cascade;

ALTER TABLE yrb_purchase add constraint yrb_pur_fk_offer_with_del
foreign key (club, title, year) references yrb_offer on delete cascade;

--Test constraint one
--DELETE FROM yrb_book WHERE TITLE='Humor in SQL'
--SELECT * FROM yrb_book Where TITLE='Humor in SQL'


-- Part A Question 2
-- I am literally dropping the existed constraints and  writing a new ones according to the question requirements
-- in part A i am making sure that if a customer wants to buy a book not offered in the customer club the insertion of that purchase will be
-- rejected and Since we know that in yrb_create.sql already has the required constraint,
--any insertion where a cid member does not match with the club as these are composite keys, the terminal will return error saying such foreign key does not exist.

alter table yrb_purchase drop constraint yrb_pur_fk_mem;
alter table yrb_member drop constraint yrb_mem_fk_cust;


alter table yrb_member add constraint yrb_mem_fk_cust_v2
        foreign key (cid) references yrb_customer;


alter table yrb_purchase add constraint yrb_pur_fk_mem_re
        foreign key (club, cid) references yrb_member;



-- part A Question 3 i have written a trigger which makes sure that every time
-- a customer is added or inserted into the yrb_customer
-- it should automatically make that customer a member of basic club
CREATE TRIGGER basic_member
              AFTER INSERT ON YRB_CUSTOMER REFERENCING NEW ROW AS NewTuple
              FOR EACH ROW
              INSERT INTO yrb_member(CLUB,CID)
              VALUES('Basic',NewTuple.CID);


---Test Constraint for 3rd
INSERT INTO yrb_customer(CID,NAME,CITY) VALUES(215,'JALEEL','TORONTO');
SELECT * FROM yrb_member WHERE CID=215;


--Test constraint one
DELETE FROM yrb_book WHERE TITLE='Humor in SQL';
SELECT * FROM yrb_book Where TITLE='Humor in SQL';

--Test constraint for quesion 2
---INSERT INTO YRB_PURCHASE(CID, CLUB, TITLE, YEAR, WHEN, QNTY) VALUES (100, 'bbb', 'Eigen Eigen', 1980, '2001-07-14-11.36.00.000000', 1);
--this is the error you are suppose to get
----when you run it and test ou get this error The insert or update value of the FOREIGN KEY
---"JALEEL24.YRB_PURCHASE.YRB_PUR_FK_OFFER_WITH_DEL" is not equal to any value of
--the parent key of the parent table


INSERT INTO YRB_PURCHASE(CID, CLUB, TITLE, YEAR, WHEN, QNTY) VALUES (100, 'bbb', 'Eigen Eigen', 2080, '2001-07-14-11.36.00.000000', 1);
